Simple Firefox addon inspired by LastTab (which sadly doesn't work anymore).

Addon provides a list of tabs in most recently used (MRU) order. Triggered by Ctrl-Tab or Alt-Tab. 

Features:
1. Triggered by Ctrl-Tab or Alt-Tab (configurable)
2. Shift modifier cycles tabs in reverse order
3. Configuration available to set max number of tabs to be kept in the MRU list
4. Works across multiple windows - each window maintains its own MRU list of tabs
5. Focus of last used tab when current tab is closed
